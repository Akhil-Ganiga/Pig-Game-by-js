The Pig Game is a web-based implementation of the popular dice game where players compete to reach a target score. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game features two players who take turns rolling dice. Each player accumulates points with each roll but risks losing all points for the current turn if they roll a 1. Players can choose to "hold" their current points, adding them to their total score and passing the turn to the next player. JavaScript handles the game logic, including dice rolling, score tracking, and determining the winner. This interactive game provides entertainment and excitement for players of all ages, testing their luck and decision-making skills.
